# Udacity-Deep_Learning_Foundation
This is a repository meant to document my education of Deep Learning.  It includes the 5 projects from the Udacity Deep Learning curriculum.  It demonstrates the ability to train deep neural networks to solve a variety of AI related problems.

## Projects
### 1. Neural network

A simple neural network from scratch to make predictions of bike-sharing usage.

### 2. Object Detection using CNN

The task of this project is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset was preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. I have also normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, built a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.

The task of this project is to generate your new Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. We have used Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. We have word level RNN over embedding to generate each word based on previous words

The task of this project is to translate English to French. We have trained a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences.

In this project we trained de-covolution Generator and a Convolution Discriminator to generate new realistic faces. We have used images of celebrities as our training data
